# Kotlin Practice Exercises

This repository contains a series of Kotlin practice exercises that I completed as part of my professional development in the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course. The exercises are designed to reinforce the fundamental concepts of Kotlin programming within the context of Android app development.

## Overview

The Kotlin exercises presented here are part of my ongoing efforts to master Android development, focusing specifically on the modern UI toolkit, Jetpack Compose. Each exercise addresses core programming concepts and builds a solid foundation for more advanced Android development tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these exercises, I aimed to solidify my understanding of key Kotlin features and programming paradigms that are essential for effective Android app development. The specific learning outcomes include:

- **Variables and Functions**: Understanding how to declare and use variables and functions in Kotlin to manage data and functionality within an app.

- **Displaying Text Output**: Implementing basic Kotlin syntax to display text outputs on the user interface, an essential skill for any app developer.

- **Conditionals and Function Types**: Leveraging Kotlin's control flow mechanisms, such as if-else and when statements, to execute code based on conditions. Exploring different types of functions, including single-expression functions and anonymous functions (lambda expressions).

- **Classes and Lambda Expressions**: Diving into object-oriented programming in Kotlin by defining and using classes and objects. Utilising lambda expressions to simplify the code where functions are used as parameters.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several classes, and questions within those classes, each corresponding to a different aspect of Kotlin programming covered in the exercises.

Feel free to explore each directory to see specific examples and my implementations.

## How to Use This Repository

To get the most out of these exercises, clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file. You can open the project in Android Studio or any compatible IDE that supports Kotlin to run the exercises and modify them as you see fit.

## Conclusion

These Kotlin practice exercises represent a key component of my learning journey in Android app development. They reflect my commitment to building a strong foundation in Kotlin and my dedication to advancing my skills in a structured, methodical manner.
